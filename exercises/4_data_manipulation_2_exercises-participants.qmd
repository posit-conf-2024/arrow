# User-defined functions

## Problem

1.  Write a user-defined function which wraps the `stringr` function `str_replace_na()`, and use it to replace any `NA` values in the `vendor_name` column with the string "No vendor" instead. (Test it on the data from 2019 so you're not pulling everything into memory)

## Solution 1

```{r}
#| label: udf-solution

```


# Joins

## Problem

1.  How many taxi pickups were recorded in 2019 from the three major airports covered by the NYC Taxis data set (JFK, LaGuardia, Newark)? (Hint: you can use `stringr::str_detect()` to help you find pickup zones with the word "Airport" in them)

## Solution 1

```{r}
#| label: airport-pickup

```
